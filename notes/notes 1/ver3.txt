1-- created urls.py in shortner(app folder)
2-- added these imports statements:
from django.urls import path
from . import views

3-- then added this array :
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]

4-- then go to views.py and added this function :

def index(request):
    return render(request, 'index.html')

5-- uptill now we did views,urls etc (for app aka) in shortner now we have to integrate urls from shortner 
to (main app aka) urlshortner.

6-- go to urlshortner's urls.py and change 
from django.urls import path
to from django.urls import path, include 
basically add include in above

7-- then this to urlpatterns :
path('', include('shortner.urls'))

8-- now --> python manage.py runserver (in gitbash or terminal)
